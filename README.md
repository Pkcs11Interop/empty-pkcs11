## Overview

EMPTY-PKCS11 is minimalistic C library that implements [PKCS#11 v3.1](https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/PKCS11-SPECS/tree/master/v3.1) API in the simplest possible way - all PKCS#11 functions except `C_GetFunctionList`, `C_GetInterfaceList` and `C_GetInterface` return `CKR_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED` return value.

It has been tested on several desktop and mobile platforms and as such can be used as a lightweight skeleton for the development of portable PKCS#11 libraries.

## Download

Signed precompiled binaries as well as source code releases can be downloaded from [releases page](https://github.com/Pkcs11Interop/empty-pkcs11/releases).  
Archives with source code are signed with [GnuPG key of Jaroslav Imrich](https://www.jimrich.sk/crypto/).  
Windows libraries are signed with [code-signing certificate of Jaroslav Imrich](https://www.jimrich.sk/crypto/).

## Building the source

### Windows

Execute the build script on a 64-bit Windows machine with [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (or newer) installed:

	cd build/windows/
	build.bat
	
The script should use Visual Studio to build both 32-bit (`empty-pkcs11-x86.dll`) and 64-bit (`empty-pkcs11-x64.dll`) versions of the library.

### Linux

Execute the build script on a 64-bit Linux machine with GCC, GNU Make and GCC multilib support installed (available in [build-essential](https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/build-essential) and [gcc-multilib](https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/gcc-multilib) packages on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS):

	cd build/linux/
	sh build.sh

The script should use GCC to build both 32-bit (`empty-pkcs11-x86.so`) and 64-bit (`empty-pkcs11-x64.so`) versions of the library.

### macOS

Execute the build script on a 64-bit macOS machine with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and its "Command Line Tools" extension installed:

	cd build/macos/
	sh build.sh

The script should use GCC to build both 32-bit (`empty-pkcs11-x86.dylib`) and 64-bit (`empty-pkcs11-x64.dylib`) versions of the library.

### Android

Execute the build script on a 64-bit Windows machine with [Android NDK r26d](https://developer.android.com/ndk/) (or newer) unpacked in `C:\android-ndk` folder:

	cd build/android/
	build.bat
	
The script should use Android NDK to build the library for all supported architectures. Results will be located in `libs` directory and its subdirectories.

### iOS

Execute the build script on a 64-bit macOS machine with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and its "Command Line Tools" extension installed:

	cd build/ios/
	sh build.sh

The script should use Xcode to build the library with iphonesimulator SDK (`libempty-pkcs11-iphonesimulator.a`) and iphoneos SDK (`libempty-pkcs11-iphoneos.a`).
